Red Team Engagement – Security Assessment
This project is the result of my work in planning and conducting a Red Team operation for Bean Enterprises. As part of the assessment, I developed three key documents: Resource Plan, Operations Plan, and Mission Plan, which detail the attack process, techniques used, and organizational aspects.

What Was Done?
1. Developing the Resource Plan
I created a document outlining all the necessary resources for a successful engagement, including:

Team composition (lead, assistant, operators).

Testing phases (reconnaissance, initial access, persistence, remediation).

Required resources (AWS cloud infrastructure, budget, operational setup).

This helped clearly define what was needed for the attack and streamlined coordination with the client.

2. Developing the Operations Plan
In this document, I defined:

Testing objectives – what security weaknesses are being assessed.

Communication processes – how the team interacts internally and with the client.

Attack tactics and techniques – phishing methods, evasion techniques, and C2 deployment.

Engagement halting conditions – scenarios in which testing must be stopped.

This document was essential for aligning team actions and minimizing risks.

3. Developing the Mission Plan
Here, I detailed the exact steps for executing the attack:

Preparing a phishing campaign.

Setting up Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.

Masking activity within the network.

Selecting target machines and users.

This document served as a guide for Red Team operators, ensuring a structured attack execution.

Outcome
As a result, I developed a complete documentation set for conducting a Red Team engagement. These documents can be used as a template for future tests or adapted for new scenarios.

This project showcases my skills in Red Team engagement planning, security assessment, and attack execution strategies.
